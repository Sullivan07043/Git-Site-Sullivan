            <h3>Recommendation Algorithm Analysis</h3>
            <p>	Explored the field of recommendation algorithms in machine learning, focusing on the application of cutting-edge technologies such as matrix factorization and graph neural networks in recommendation systems. Conducted experiments and analyses to evaluate the performance of these two major categories of algorithms in handling cold start scenarios.</p>
<p>	Selected the 2023 Amazon book review dataset of "user-reviews" as the research subject. Used collaborative filtering methods to achieve precise "user-book" matching recommendations and related book recommendations.</p>
<p>	Evaluated comprehensively the algorithms, including the matrix factorization parts (NMF and SVD) and the graph neural network parts (GCN, LGCN, and GAN). Assessed the algorithms' performance across multiple dimensions, such as efficiency and accuracy, while considering various environments and multiple indicators to find the relatively optimal recommendation algorithm for this dataset.</p>
<p>	Deeply explored the performance of each algorithm in different subfields, revealing their respective strengths and limitations, such as generalization effectiveness and cold start performance. Provided scientific evidence for the design and optimization of recommendation systems through comprehensive analysis, thereby enhancing user experience and promoting the efficient and precise dissemination of information.</p>
<p>	Wrote a course paper: "Recommend? An Analysis of Recommendation Algorithms on the Amazon Book Review Dataset."

            <h3>Momentum Change in Tennis (MCM)</h3>
            <p>	Used KPCA (Kernel Principal Component Analysis) for feature selection in analyzing the momentum changes of tennis players throughout matches in the MCM-C problem. </p>
<p>	Applied BP (Backpropagation Neural Network) and logistic regression algorithms to make relevant predictions, aiming to analyze and predict momentum change points.</p>
<p>	To address generalization issues across different tasks, proposed a meta-learning solution, which significantly improved the generalization performance of the logistic regression algorithm on multi-task platforms.</p>

            <h3>Research on Supervised Machine Learning Algorithms  (Study at UCSD)</h3>
            <p>	Conducted a large-scale comparison among three supervised learning methods: KNN, Naïve Bayes, and Logistic Regression. Selected three representative datasets that covered various scales, feature complexities, and classification difficulties to ensure the broad applicability and reliability of the experimental results.</p>
<p>	Used cross-validation to perform multiple training and testing runs on each dataset for each classifier to accurately assess their classification accuracy.</p>
<p>	For each algorithm, optimized hyperparameters to the best configuration through a meticulous tuning process to ensure maximum performance of the algorithms.</p>
<p>	Evaluated the performance of each classifier using cross-validation on the three datasets, documenting training errors, validation errors, and test errors for different data split ratios (20/80, 50/50, 80/20) to comprehensively analyze the algorithms' performance across varying data distributions.</p>
<p>	Final conclusion: KNN showed the best overall performance, but it performed poorly on smaller datasets; among the datasets used in this experiment, Naïve Bayes had the worst performance; Logistic Regression demonstrated the strongest versatility, showing relatively excellent classification results across various tasks.
